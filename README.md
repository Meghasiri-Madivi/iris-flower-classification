# 🌼 Iris Flower Classification

## 📄 Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

The prediction is based on four features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

- We use the classic **Iris dataset**, which is included in the `scikit-learn` library.
- No need to download any external files.

---

## ⚙️ Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration

- Load the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`.
- Explore data using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Scale features using StandardScaler.

### 3️⃣ Model Building

- Train a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier.

### 4️⃣ Evaluation

- Evaluate the model using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.

### 5️⃣ Real-Time Prediction

- Accept new flower measurements and instantly predict the species.

---

## ✅ Results

- Achieved **high accuracy (usually above 95%)** on the test set.
- Can predict new flower species in real-time using sepal and petal measurements.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 💻 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

### ▶️ Steps

1️⃣ Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification
```

2️⃣ Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
python iris_classification.py
```

or

```bash
jupyter notebook Iris_Classification.ipynb
```

3️⃣ To predict a new flower, update the `new_data` array in the code with your own measurements.

---

## 💡 Example Real-Time Prediction

```python
new_data = np.array([[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]])  # example input
scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)
prediction = knn.predict(scaled)
print("Predicted Species:", iris.target_names[prediction[0]])
```

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- Pair plots to show feature relationships and species separation.
- Confusion matrix heatmap to evaluate model performance.
- Optional decision boundary plot (if using two features for visualization).

---

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Build an interactive web app using Streamlit for live predictions.
- Try other algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees) for comparison.
- Deploy as an API service.
